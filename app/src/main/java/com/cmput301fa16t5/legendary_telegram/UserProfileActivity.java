/**
This is the activity called upon when:
1) A new user account is to be created (reached by login activity).
2) An existing user account to be modified (reached by main request activity)

In the first case, the fields are to be blank, filled with nothing, and the button at the bottom (changeSettings)
says "create new account"

In the second case, the fields are to be filled with the existing information about the user, which they can modify.
The button at the bottom will say "change settings"

The check button at the top checks the name entered into the field. If a user with that name already exists
a new user account cannot be made/the existing account cannot be modified. 

When the user creates or modifies an account the function that checks the name should be called anyway. THe 
separate button exists for convience.
