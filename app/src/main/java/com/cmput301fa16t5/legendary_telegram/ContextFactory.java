/**
 * Created on 11/18/2016.
 * Purpose of this class:
 * Gson Requires a Context Object to work.
 * If one were to pass a Singleton  (Central Controller) a context object at the start of the
 * code and tell it to hold onto that context for Gson use, Android Studio would complain that
 * this is a memory leak, potentially.
 * Instead, we have a class object that will hold onto our context, but is not a singleton itself.
