 * Enum describing the states of Request

 * Request is initially made set to openRequest.
 * If the initial post to ElasticSearch fails,
 * it will be set to pendingUpload.
 *
 * hasADriver is the state it takes when it is accepting Drivers.
 *
 * acceptedADriver is when a Rider has picked a Driver, and can no longer accept new Drivers.
 *
 * Driver has committed confirms that the Driver is on their way.
 *
 * There is no "complete" option; as the ride comes to a close the Rider's Client will
 * wipe the request from ESearch.
